# applied ml lab 1
In this project, we used a data-driven approach to attempt to predict the world population of the year 2122. Our final estimation was 10.7 billion people.

*population.cvs* is the only dataset used for this project. It is from the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?most_recent_year_desc=true)

*pop_prediction.ipynb* is the jupyter notebook containing our code, graphs, and write up of our methods. 

*pop_prediction.pdf* is simply a pdf version of the jupyter notebook
